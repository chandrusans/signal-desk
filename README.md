# Signal Desk

A momentum-swing signals dashboard for self-directed equity research. Pulls live prices from Yahoo Finance, computes real technical indicators, ranks tickers by a transparent composite score, and produces ATR-based trade plans with mechanical entry/exit rules.

**Not investment advice.** This is a research tool. See in-page disclosure.

**Beginners**: read the handbook at `/handbook` (or `handbook.html` in this repo). It explains the point system, setup states, trade plans, and every feature in plain language, with a versioned changelog.

**Contributors**: `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root spells out the handbook maintenance rule — any change to scoring, setups, indicators, or data sources requires a same-commit update to `handbook.html`.

## What it does

- **Live prices**: 1-year OHLC + volume via Yahoo Finance chart API (no auth key). Polls every 30 seconds.
- **Real analytics**: SMA (10/20/50/200), RSI(14), ATR(14), 20d/60d returns, 52-week high distance, volume expansion.
- **Composite score (0–100)**: transparent breakdown — trend (30) + momentum (25) + location (20) + volume (15) + volatility (10).
- **Setup classifier**: `BREAKOUT`, `PULLBACK`, `EARLY`, `EXTENDED`, `BROKEN`, `AVOID` — each with mechanical entry rules.
- **Trade plans**: ATR-derived stops (`max(1.5×ATR, 5%)`, capped at 10%), 2.5R targets, 15 trading-day time stops.
- **Regime filter**: fetches ^VIX; halves sizing at 20–25, blocks new longs above 25.
- **Screener**: filters 20+ tickers by score, market cap, P/E, momentum, sentiment, setup state.

## Structure

```
signal-desk/
├── index.html         Dashboard UI (all inline CSS/JS)
├── analyze.js         Pure computation module — indicators, score, setup, trade plan
├── api/
│   └── quotes.js      Vercel serverless function — Yahoo Finance proxy
└── vercel.json        Static + serverless config
```

## Local dev

`index.html` uses `<script type="module">` and fetches `/api/quotes`, so it needs a real server (not `file://`). Options:

```bash
# Option A — Vercel CLI (recommended, runs the api function too)
npx vercel dev

# Option B — any static server + real API function URL
# The dashboard will show "feed unavailable" without the API
```

## Deploy to Vercel

```bash
npx vercel        # first time — links project
npx vercel --prod # deploy
```

Vercel auto-detects `api/quotes.js` as a serverless function. No env vars needed.

## API

`GET /api/quotes?tickers=NVDA,PLTR,^VIX&range=1y`

Returns:

```json
{
  "asOf": 1721671200000,
  "range": "1y",
  "quotes": {
    "NVDA": {
      "price": 213.95,

      "currency": "USD",
      "asOf": 1721671200000
    }
  }
}
```

## What's live

- Prices, OHLC, volume, VIX regime → `/api/quotes` (Yahoo Finance)
- News headlines + keyword-based sentiment per ticker → `/api/news` (Yahoo Finance search)
- News sentiment feeds into the composite score as a **catalyst adjustment** (max ±10 pts)

## What's still mock

- The pinned ticker list is hand-picked (NVDA / PLTR / CRWD / HOOD / ASML) — Round 3 would auto-populate from top-scoring universe candidates
- Insider / options-flow / analyst-rating narratives in the intel feed still hardcoded
- Screener market cap and P/E values still hardcoded (need Finnhub free tier)

## Reddit — future add-on (requires OAuth)

Reddit blocked anonymous JSON reads in 2023, so pulling mention counts requires registering an app:

1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps → **Create app** → type **script**
2. Note the `client_id` (under the app name) and `client_secret`
3. In Vercel project settings → **Environment Variables**, add:
   - `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`
   - `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` (e.g. `signal-desk/1.0 by chandrusans`)
4. Redeploy — an `api/reddit.js` handler can then use the client-credentials OAuth flow (60 req/min) to search r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing per ticker.

That endpoint isn't shipped yet — say the word and it's ~1 hour of work once you have the credentials.
